"1",413,"Objectives. The study examined the long-term course of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by analyzing rates of recurrence and the predictive value of comorbid psychiatric disorders and psychosocial functioning. Methods. This study is based on diagnostic assessments administered at intake and subsequent follow-up interviews over a period of 15 years in a sample of 90 anxiety-disordered patients with comorbid PTSD who participated in the Harvard Brown Anxiety Research project (HARP). KaplanMeier life table analysis revealed a 0.20 probability of full remission during the 15 years of follow-up. Results. Latent growth model (LGM) analysis revealed that the number of trauma exposures was a predictor of a worse course of PTSD but only during some intervals of the 15-year follow-up. Subjects with full social phobia were more likely to experience worsening of PTSD over time in comparison with subjects with less severe social phobia. Role functioning in the areas of household and employment was a significant predictor of a declining course of PTSD. Conclusions. These findings revealed the dynamic nature of the predictive value of traumatic experiences, the deleterious effect of social phobia and the long term effect of psychosocial functioning on the course of PTSD. Implications for treatment planning and development of interventions for PTSD are discussed. © 2013 Informa Healthcare.","predictors of the long-term course of comorbid ptsd: a naturalistic prospective study",1,0

"3",740,"Background: Most previous attempts to determine the psychological cost of military deployment have been limited by reliance on convenience samples, lack of pre-deployment data or confidentiality and cross-sectional designs. Aims: This study addressed these limitations using a population-based, prospective cohort of US military personnel deployed in support of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Method: The sample consisted of US military service members in all branches including active duty, reserve and national guard who deployed once (n = 3393) or multiple times (n = 4394). Self-reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress were obtained prior to deployment and at two follow-ups spaced 3 years apart. Data were examined for longitudinal trajectories using latent growth mixture modelling. Results: Each analysis revealed remarkably similar post-traumatic stress trajectories across time. The most common pattern was low-stable post-traumatic stress or resilience (83.1% single deployers, 84.9% multiple deployers), moderate-improving (8.0%, 8.5%), then worsening-chronic post-traumatic stress (6.7%, 4.5%), high-stable (2.2% single deployers only) and high-improving (2.2% multiple deployers only). Covariates associated with each trajectory were identified. Conclusions: The final models exhibited similar types of trajectories for single and multiple deployers; most notably, the stable trajectory of low post-traumatic stress pre- to post-deployment, or resilience, was exceptionally high. Several factors predicting trajectories were identified, which we hope will assist in future research aimed at decreasing the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder among deployers.","trajectories of trauma symptoms and resilience in deployed us military service members: prospective cohort study",1,1

"5",1689,"We conducted a follow-up assessment to assess the development of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and depression among Chinese immigrants after the World Trade Center attack. Sixty-five Chinese displaced workers who were originally interviewed in May 2002 were re-interviewed in March 2003. Whereas depression scores decreased over time, average PTSD scores remained unchanged. The trajectory of posttraumatic stress symptoms was more complex, with an increasing number of individuals who show no or little emotional health problems and another increasing group of individuals with exacerbated posttraumatic stress symptoms. Although the mean values of the re-experiencing and hypervigilance cluster did not change over time, the mean value of the avoidance/numbing cluster increased significantly from time 1 (M = 4.60, SD = 4.98) to time 2 (M = 6.34, SD = 4.24), (F1.61 = 5.69, P = .02). A higher proportion of subjects met diagnostic criteria of PTSD at time 2 (27%) than at time 1 (21%). The study highlights the importance of ongoing mental health surveillance of diverse cultural and linguistic groups after a major traumatic event. (copyright) The Author 2005.

DSM-III criteria for diagnosis were used to measure and operationally define posttraumatic stress disorder. Five variables distinguished between groups: veterans with the disorder reported a negative perception of their family's helpfulness on return home, a higher level of combat, a more immediate discharge after the war, an external locus of control, and a more supportive attitude toward the war before they entered the service. The authors discuss the implications and limitations of these findings.","discriminant analysis of the posttraumatic stress disorder among a group of viet nam veterans",1,0

All 399 items were submitted to chi-square analysis to select those differentiating acute or chronic PTSD from controls. The analyses yielded an MMPI Acute PTSD scale (32 items) and a MMPI Chronic PTSD scale (41 items). Discriminating between acute PTSD and controls, the MMPI Acute PTSD scale had a hit rate of 83% and the MMPI Chronic PTSD scale produced a hit rate of 75% to 80%. Cross-validation produced similar hit rates.

METHOD: Participants included 153 youth with a history of cancer and 101 youth without a history of serious illness (8-19 years). Children completed measures of connectedness, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and benefit-finding. Parents also reported on children's PTSS. RESULTS: Latent profile analysis revealed four profiles: high connectedness (45%), low connectedness (6%), connectedness primarily to parents (40%), and connectedness primarily to peers (9%). These profiles did not differ by history of cancer. However, profiles differed on PTSS and benefit-finding. Children highly connected across domains displayed the lowest PTSS and highest benefit-finding, while those with the lowest connectedness had the highest PTSS, with moderate PTSS and benefit-finding for the parent and peer profiles. CONCLUSION: Children with cancer demonstrate patterns of connectedness similar to their healthy peers. Findings support connectedness as a possible mechanism facilitating resilience and growth.","profiles of connectedness: processes of resilience and growth in children with cancer",1,0

"15",6130,"OBJECTIVE: Suicidal ideation in veterans is of great concern. The objective of this study is to examine how heterogeneous posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) trajectories are associated with postdeployment suicidal ideation in veterans 2.5 years postdeployment to a combat zone in Afghanistan. If PTSD trajectories are associated with postdeployment suicidal ideations, then the accumulative knowledge on what characterizes veterans falling into different PTSD trajectories may provide better opportunities for early identification of suicidal high-risk veterans. METHOD: In this prospective study of 743 Danish soldiers deployed to Afghanistan from February to August in 2009, we collected data at 6 time points from 6 weeks before deployment to 2.5 years after homecoming (total for this study: 456). At all assessments, the soldiers responded to a comprehensive questionnaire including measures of PTSD (measured by the PTSD Checklist, Civilian Version) and other mental and physical health variables, demographics, and social and combat-related factors. Suicidal ideation was measured by an item from the European Parasuicide Study Interview Schedule II. In a previous study based on soldiers from this cohort, we identified 6 PTSD trajectories using latent growth mixture modeling, which we have extracted and applied as independent variables in this study. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied to examine whether deployed soldiers with certain PTSD symptom trajectories were more likely to report suicidal ideation 2.5 years after homecoming. RESULTS: Two PTSD trajectories with high PTSD symptom level 2.5 years after return were significantly associated with suicidal ideation 2.5 years after homecoming. Thus, a relieved-worsening class, described by initial decreasing PTSD symptom levels followed by a steep increase in symptoms had higher risk of suicidal ideation (OR = 7.84; 95% CI, 1.68-36.6), which was also the case for a late-onset class (OR 5.2; 95% CI, 2.21-12.24) when compared to a low-stable class.

In 6- to 24-week well designed trials, oral paroxetine 10 to 50 mg/day was significantly more effective than placebo, at least as effective as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and as effective as other SSRIs and other antidepressants in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Relapse or recurrence over 1 year after the initial response was significantly lower with paroxetine 10 to 50 mg/day than with placebo and similar to that with imipramine 50 to 275 mg/day. The efficacy of paroxetine 10 to 40 mg/day was similar to that of TCAs and fluoxetine 20 to 60 mg/day in 6- to 12-week trials in patients aged (greater-than or equal to)60 years with major depression. Paroxetine 10 to 40 mg/day improved depressive symptoms to an extent similar to that of TCAs in patients with comorbid illness, and was more effective than placebo in the treatment of dysthymia and minor depression. Paroxetine 20 to 60 mg/day was more effective than placebo after 8 to 12 weeks' treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Improvement was maintained or relapse was prevented for 24 weeks to 1 year in patients with OCD, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder or GAD. The efficacy of paroxetine was similar to that of other SSRIs in patients with OCD and panic disorder and similar to that of imipramine but greater than that of 2'chlordesmethyldiazepam in patients with GAD. Paroxetine is generally well tolerated in adults, elderly individuals and patients with comorbid illness, with a tolerability profile similar to that of other SSRIs. The most common adverse events with paroxetine were nausea, sexual dysfunction, somnolence, asthenia, headache, constipation, dizziness, sweating, tremor and decreased appetite. In conclusion, paroxetine, in common with other SSRIs, is generally better tolerated than TCAs and is a first-line treatment option for major depressive disorder, dysthymia or minor depression. Like other SSRIs, paroxetine is also an appropriate first-line therapy for OCD, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, GAD and PTSD. Notably, paroxetine is the only SSRI currently approved for the treatment of social anxiety disorder and GAD, which makes it the only drug of its class indicated for all five anxiety disorders in addition to major depressive disorder. Thus, given the high degree of psychiatric comorbidity of depression and anxiety, paroxetine is an important first-line option for the treatment of major depressive disorder, OCD, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, GAD and PTSD.","spotlight on paroxetine in psychiatric disorders in adults",0,0
